# FAQ

## Tech Support / Common Issues

### I'm stuck
Take a look at one of [these walkthroughs](https://www.cavestory.org/guides-and-faqs/list.php).

### The game feels slow
The Nicalis ports run faster, you're probably used to those.
Enable the "CS+ Speed" setting in the config menu for something similar.

### The save disks are missing. What's going on?
SRAM is malfunctioning, or not emulated properly.
Check [COMPATIBILITY.md](COMPATIBILITY.md) for a list of tested carts and emulators.

### I found something inaccurate
If you encounter something that is obviously a glitch or bug, then I would like to hear about it.
However, please do not open issues with minor discrepancies for the sake of "accuracy".
If accuracy is your main concern, that is what CSE2 is for.

### I found a bug in an old version
If you can't reproduce in the latest release, don't report it.
The save data for version 0.5.0 onwards are all compatible with each other.

### Can you add new languages and game modes?
I may add your language if you have a translated PC version available,
but no more feature requests. I want to release 1.0 and be done.


## General Questions

### Is this an official port?
No. Pixel probably doesn't even know it exists.

### Why did you make it?
To learn MD dev.

### Why not SNES?
I'm not interested in SNES dev.

### When will it be "finished"?
When there are few enough bugs that it doesn't bother me anymore.

### Is there or will there be physical release?
No. 

### Can I make carts?
Feel free to make carts for yourself or friends, but *do not sell them*.

### But I saw someone else selling carts
It's a scam. Demand your money back.

### Is this moddable?

### Can I use your code in my commercial game?
Yes, just give credit. Check the [license](LICENSE.md).

### I have an idea for a Genesis game can you code it for free?
No.
