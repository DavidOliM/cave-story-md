# FAQ

## Tech Support / Common Issues

### I'm stuck
Take a look at one of [these walkthroughs](https://www.cavestory.org/guides-and-faqs/list.php).

### The game feels slow
The Nicalis ports run faster, you're probably used to those.
Enable the "CS+ Speed (NTSC Only)" setting in the config menu for something similar.

### The save disks are missing. What's going on?
Your cart or emulator does not support the type of SRAM used by the game.
Check [COMPATIBILITY.md](COMPATIBILITY.md) for a list of tested carts and emulators.

### I found something inaccurate
Because this is a "port", the moment someone finds out about it they hyper-focus on
finding discrepancies with the original game.
In the past, I would entertain issues that people opened about these, but things
really got out of hand. I ended up with a 3 digit issue tab full of minor differences
and often duplicate posts. It burned me out big time resulting in a pretty long hiatus.

These days I'm not interested in issues like these. Please do not open them.
If you are concerned about accuracy, look at CSE2, or just play the original.

### I found a bug in an old version
If you can't reproduce in the latest release, please don't report it.
The save data for version 0.5.0 onwards are all compatible with each other.

### Can you add new languages and game modes?



## General Questions

### Is this an official port?
No. Pixel probably doesn't even know it exists.

### Why did you make it?
To learn MD dev.

### Why not SNES?
I'm not interested in SNES dev.

### When will it be "finished"?
When there are few enough bugs that it doesn't bother me anymore.

### Is there or will there be physical release?
No. 

### Can I make carts?
Feel free to make carts for yourself or friends, but don't sell them.

Yes, but
