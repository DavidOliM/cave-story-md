# FAQ

## Tech Support / Common Issues

### I'm stuck
Take a look at one of [these walkthroughs](https://www.cavestory.org/guides-and-faqs/list.php).

### The game feels slow
The Nicalis ports run faster, you're probably used to those.
Enable the "CS+ Speed" setting in the config menu for something similar.

### The save disks are missing. What's going on?
SRAM is malfunctioning, or not emulated properly.
Check [COMPATIBILITY.md](COMPATIBILITY.md) for a list of tested carts and emulators.

### I found something inaccurate
I'm no longer interested in issues like this.
If your main concern is accuracy, don't play CSMD. Check out CSE2, or even the original.

In the past I did accept and fix issues that people opened about discrepancies with the
original Cave Story, but this resulted in a 3 digit issue tab full of minor differences
and often duplicate posts. It burned me out big time resulting in a pretty long hiatus.

### I found a bug in an old version
If you can't reproduce in the latest release, don't report it.
The save data for version 0.5.0 onwards are all compatible with each other.

### Can you add new languages and game modes?
I may add your language if you have a translated PC version available,
but no more feature requests. I want to release 1.0 and be done.


## General Questions

### Is this an official port?
No. Pixel probably doesn't even know it exists.

### Why did you make it?
To learn MD dev.

### Why not SNES?
I'm not interested in SNES dev.

### When will it be "finished"?
When there are few enough bugs that it doesn't bother me anymore.

### Is there or will there be physical release?
No. 

### Can I make carts?
Feel free to make carts for yourself or friends, but don't sell them.

### Is this moddable?

### Can I use your code in my commercial game?
Yes. Check the license.

No.
